Hi! My name is Bendeguz. I’m a programmer living in Hungary. I’m currently working in the domain of IT Security.

My interests are mainly systems programming, embedded systems and computer science in general, mainly the theory of computation and programming languages.

I’m a firm believer of FOSS, the importance of decentralization, the UNIX philosophy and the hacker mindset. I think programming is one of the most creative and intellectually satisfying activities one can pursue.

In my free time I love coming up with ideas for new pet projects, and hoping that in the future days will consist of more than 24 hours, so I’ll even be able to finish them. I’m probably spending way more time tinkering with my development environment than one can consider healthy. And I’m pretty sure I spend more time automating things than it would be [worth it](https://xkcd.com/1205/).
